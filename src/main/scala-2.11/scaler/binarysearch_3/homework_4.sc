//Given an array of integers A and two integers B and C.
//
//In one operation, you can select any number of elements from A and update them like:
//
//A[i] = (A[i] + X) % B, where 0 <= X <= C, and X can have different values for different elements of A.
//Find and return the minimum number of operations to sort the array in non-decreasing order.
