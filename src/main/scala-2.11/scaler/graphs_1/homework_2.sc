//Given an integer A, representing number of vertices in a graph.
//Also you are given a matrix of integers B of size N x 3 where N represents number of Edges in a Graph and Triplet (B[i][0], B[i][1], B[i][2]) implies there is an undirected edge between B[i][0] and B[i][1] and weight of that edge is B[i][2].
//Find and return the weight of minimum weighted cycle and if there is no cycle return -1 instead.
//NOTE: Graph may contain multiple edges and self loops.
